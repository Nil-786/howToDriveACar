            Driving Techniques
        </h1>
        <p>
            Here we'll covers essential techniques for driving both manual and automatic transmission cars. Whether
            you're familiar with manual gear shifting or prefer the simplicity of automatic transmission, this page
            provides valuable insights for mastering the art of driving. <br>
            For <Strong> Manual transmission cars</Strong>, we delve into the fundamental skills of clutch control, gear shifting, and
            smooth coordination between the accelerator, clutch, and brake pedals. We explain the concept of the biting
            point and provide guidance on shifting gears effectively to ensure a seamless driving experience. <br>
            In the case of <strong> Automatic transmission cars</strong>, we focus on understanding the various driving modes, such as
            Drive (D), Reverse (R), and Park (P), and when to use them. We highlight the importance of proper
            utilization of the accelerator and brake pedals in an automatic car, as well as the significance of the
            handbrake for parking and emergency situations. <br>
        </p>

        <h1 class="heading">Driving a Manual car</h1>

        <p>A manual car, also known as a "stick shift" or "standard transmission" car, is a type of vehicle that requires the driver to manually shift gears using a clutch pedal and a gear lever. In a manual car, the driver has full control over gear selection, which allows for a more engaging driving experience and greater control over the vehicle's performance. </p>
        <h2>Step 1: <strong>Starting the Engine</strong></h2>
        <div class="tut1-container tut2">
            <div class="item1">
                <img src="\Public\Images\tut2_1.jpg " alt="">
            </div>
            <div class="item2">
                <p>
                    Insert the key into the ignition and turn it clockwise to start the engine. Alternatively, for modern cars with push-button start, press the start button while keeping your foot on the clutch pedal.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Step 2: <strong>Engaging the Clutch</strong></h2>
        <div class="tut1-container tut2">
            <div class="item1">
                <img src="\Public\Images\tut2_2.png " alt="">
            </div>
            <div class="item2">
                <p>
                    Press the clutch pedal down with your left foot to disengage the engine from the transmission. This allows you to change gears without stalling the engine.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Step 3: <strong>Shifting into First Gear</strong></h2>
        <div class="tut1-container tut2">
            <div class="item1">
                <img src="\Public\Images\tut2_3 (2).jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <div class="item2">
                <p>
                    With the clutch pedal still depressed, move the gear shifter into the first gear position, typically located in the top left or top left-back position.                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Step 4: <strong>Finding the biting point</strong></h2>
        <div class="tut1-container tut2">
            <div class="item1">
                <img src="\Public\Images\Tut2_4.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <div class="item2">
                <p>
                    Slowly release the clutch pedal while gently pressing the accelerator pedal. Find the biting point, which is the moment when the engine and transmission engage, and the car starts to move forward.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Step 5: <strong>Accelerating and Shifting Gears</strong></h2>
        <div class="tut1-container tut2">
            <div class="item1">
                <img src="\Public\Images\tut2_5.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <div class="item2">
                <p>
                    Gradually release the clutch pedal while simultaneously applying gentle pressure on the accelerator pedal to accelerate. Once the car reaches a higher speed or the engine revs too high, shift to the next gear by pressing the clutch pedal, moving the gear shifter to the appropriate gear, and releasing the clutch pedal smoothly.                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Step 6: <strong>Breaking and stopping</strong></h2>
        <div class="tut1-container tut2">
            <div class="item1">
                <img src="\Public\Images\tut2_6.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <div class="item2">
                <p>
                    To slow down or stop the car, release the accelerator pedal and press the brake pedal with your right foot. Remember to downshift and engage the clutch as you come to a complete stop.           
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>It's worth noting that manual cars are less common nowadays, with automatic transmissions becoming more prevalent. However, learning to drive a manual car can still be beneficial, as it provides a deeper understanding of the mechanics of a vehicle and opens up opportunities to drive manual cars in certain regions or specific vehicles that are only available in manual transmission options.</p>

        <p>An automatic car, also known as an "auto" or "automatic transmission" car, is a type of vehicle that automatically changes gears without requiring the driver to manually shift gears. In an automatic car, the transmission system manages gear changes based on factors such as vehicle speed, engine RPM, and throttle input.</p>
        <h2>Various driving modes in an <strong>Automatic car</strong> are as follows.</h2> <br>
        <ul>
            <li><p><strong>Park (P):</strong> The Park mode is used when the vehicle is stationary and parked. It locks the transmission to prevent the vehicle from rolling.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Reverse (R):</strong> The Reverse mode is engaged when the driver wants to move the vehicle backward. It allows the vehicle to be driven in reverse.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Neutral (N):</strong> The Neutral mode disengages the transmission from the engine, allowing the vehicle to roll freely without any power from the engine. This mode is used when the car is being pushed or towed.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Drive (D):</strong> The Drive mode is the default mode for normal forward driving. It allows the transmission to automatically shift gears based on the vehicle's speed and load conditions.
            </p></li>
        </ul> <br>
        <h2>Step 1: <strong>Starting the Engine</strong></h2>
        <p>Insert the key into the ignition and turn it clockwise to start the engine. Alternatively, for modern cars with push-button start, press the start button. <br></p>
        <h2>Step 2: <strong>Select the Driving Mode</strong></h2>
        <p> Move the gear lever into the "D" (Drive) position to engage the automatic transmission in the forward drive mode.In automatic cars the gear is changed automatically according to the speed of the wheels. <br></p>
        <h2>Step 3: <strong>Accelerating and Braking</strong></h2>
        <p>This process in automatic cars is same as in manual cars, place your right foot on the brake pedal and release the handbrake (if engaged). Press the brake pedal to disengage the parking brake. Then, move your right foot to the accelerator pedal and gently apply pressure to accelerate. To slow down or stop, release the accelerator pedal and press the brake pedal.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Automatic cars provide a convenient and user-friendly driving experience as they eliminate the need for manual gear changes and clutch control. This makes them popular choices for everyday commuting and city driving. <br>Overall, automatic cars offer ease of use and a smooth driving experience, particularly in situations where constant gear changes would be impractical or inconvenient.</p>

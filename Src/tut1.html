            Preparing for driving
        </h1>
        <p>Before you embark on your driving journey, it is crucial to make the necessary preparations to ensure a safe
            and comfortable experience behind the wheel. Taking the time to adjust your mirrors, seat position, and
            familiarize yourself with the vehicle's controls can significantly contribute to your overall driving
            confidence. Properly adjusting your mirrors allows for optimal visibility, reducing blind spots and
            enhancing your awareness of surrounding traffic. Positioning your seat correctly ensures a comfortable
            driving posture while maintaining a clear view of the road ahead. Familiarizing yourself with the various
            controls, such as turn signals and headlights, helps you operate the vehicle smoothly and safely.
            Additionally, checking the safety equipment, such as seat belts and airbags, guarantees that you are
            prepared for any unexpected situations on the road. By prioritizing these preparations, you lay the
            foundation for a safe and enjoyable driving experience.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Adjusting Mirrors</h2>
        <div class="tut1-container">
            <div class="item1">
                <img src="\Public\Images\tut1_1.jpg" alt="">

                <p>
                    Car mirrors play a crucial role in ensuring safety and providing a clear view of the surrounding traffic while driving. <br>
                    There are typically three main mirrors in a car: the rear-view mirror and the side mirrors (driver-side and passenger-side). <br>
                    To adjust the rear-view mirror, position it in a way that provides a clear view of the road behind you. The mirror should frame the entire rear window, allowing you to see the traffic and any approaching vehicles. Avoid tilting it too far up or down. <br>
                    The side mirrors should be adjusted to minimize blind spots. Start by sitting in the driver's seat and adjust the driver-side mirror. Lean slightly towards the left and position the mirror so that you can just see the side of your car in the edge of the mirror. Then, adjust the passenger-side mirror in a similar manner.  <br>
                </p>

        <h2>2. Seat positioning</h2>
        <div class="tut1-container">
            <div class="item1">
                <img src="\Public\Images\tut1_2.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <div class="item2">
                <p>
                    Proper seat positioning plays a vital role in ensuring comfort, control, and safety while driving a car. It not only enhances your driving experience but also reduces the risk of fatigue, discomfort, and potential injuries. <br>
                    First and foremost, adjust the seat's position in relation to the pedals and steering wheel. Ensure that you can fully press the pedals without straining your legs or stretching too far. Your knees should be slightly bent when your feet are on the pedals, allowing for smooth and efficient control. <br>
                    Next, consider the distance between your seat and the steering wheel. You should be able to reach the steering wheel with a slight bend in your elbows when your hands are positioned at the "10 o'clock" and "2 o'clock" or "9 o'clock" and "3 o'clock" positions. This provides a comfortable and balanced grip on the wheel, allowing for precise steering control. <br>
                    Lastly, pay attention to the seat's recline angle. It's recommended to have a slightly reclined seatback for proper back support and to minimize fatigue during longer drives. <br>

        <h2>3. Familiarizing with controls</h2>
        <div class="tut1-container">

                <img src="\Public\Images\tut1_3.jpg" alt="">

            <div class="item2">
                <p>
                    Familiarizing yourself with the controls of a car is essential before hitting the road. Understanding the various buttons, switches, and levers not only ensures your safety but also allows for smooth and confident operation of the vehicle. <br>
                    Start by acquainting yourself with the dashboard controls. These typically include the steering wheel, gear shifter, turn signal indicators, headlights, wipers, and climate control knobs. Take the time to learn their locations and functions <br>
                    Next, familiarize yourself with the instrument cluster. This area displays important information such as speed, fuel level, engine temperature, and warning lights. Understanding these indicators keeps you informed about the car's performance and alerts you to any potential issues that may require attention. <br>
                    Don't forget to learn the placement and operation of critical controls such as the brake pedal, accelerator pedal, and clutch (if driving a manual transmission).  <br>
                    By familiarizing yourself with the controls of a car, you gain confidence and competence in operating the vehicle. It allows for a safer, more enjoyable driving experience.

                <p>
                    Before embarking on a journey, it is crucial to check the safety equipment in your vehicle to ensure your well-being and preparedness for any unforeseen circumstances. <br>
                    First inspect the airbags to ensure they are functioning correctly. Modern vehicles are equipped with multiple airbags strategically placed throughout the cabin, including front, side, and curtain airbags. <br>
                    Additionally, check the condition of your vehicle's tires. Look for any signs of wear and tear, and ensure they are properly inflated according to the manufacturer's recommendations. <br>
                    Take a moment to inspect the headlights, taillights, and turn signals to confirm they are working correctly. <br>
                    Lastly, check the functionality of your vehicle's brakes. Ensure that the brake pedal feels firm when pressed, and there are no unusual noises or vibrations. If you notice any issues, it is essential to have them addressed by a qualified mechanic before driving. <br>

        <p>
            Understanding and following traffic rules is essential for safe and responsible driving. Traffic rules are designed to regulate the flow of vehicles and ensure the safety of drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. By obeying these rules, drivers contribute to a harmonious and organized traffic environment. This page provides an overview of the importance of traffic rules and emphasizes their role in preventing accidents and maintaining order on the roads.

        <h1 class="heading">1. Common traffic signs</h1>
        <p>
            Traffic signs are visual indicators that convey important information to drivers. They serve as a universal language on the roads, helping drivers navigate and make informed decisions. This section covers various common traffic signs and their meanings. It includes signs for speed limits, stop, yield, no entry, one-way, pedestrian crossing, traffic lights, and more. By understanding these signs, drivers can effectively interpret and respond to the instructions they convey. <br><strong>Following is a list of some important signs :</strong>
        </p> <br>
        <h2>1. Speed Limit Signs</h2>  
        <div class="tut3-item">
            <img src="\Public\Images\tut3_2.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Speed limit signs indicate the maximum permitted speed on a particular road or section of the road. These signs are crucial for ensuring safety and controlling traffic flow. They are typically circular with a red border and display the maximum speed limit in kilometers per hour (km/h).</p>
        </div> 
        <h2>2. Stop Sign</h2>  
        <div class="tut3-item">
            <img src="\Public\Images\tut3_3.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Stop signs are octagonal signs with a white background and a red border. They require drivers to come to a complete stop at the intersection and yield the right of way to vehicles and pedestrians. Drivers must wait until it is safe to proceed before continuing.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>3. Yield Signs</h2>  
        <div class="tut3-item">
            <img src="\Public\Images\tut3_4.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Yield signs are triangular with a white background and a red border. They indicate that drivers must yield the right of way to other vehicles or pedestrians. Drivers approaching a yield sign should slow down, be prepared to stop if necessary, and give way to oncoming traffic or pedestrians.</p>
        </div> 
        <h2>4. No Entry Signs</h2>  
        <div class="tut3-item">
            <img src="\Public\Images\tut3_5.jpg" alt="">
            <p>No entry signs are circular with a red border and a white background. They indicate that entry into a particular road or area is prohibited. Drivers must not enter or proceed in the direction specified by the sign.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>5. One-Way Signs</h2>  
        <div class="tut3-item">
            <img src="\Public\Images\tut3_6.jpg" alt="">
            <p>One-way signs indicate that traffic is allowed to flow in only one direction on a specific road or lane. These signs are usually rectangular with a white background, a black arrow, and sometimes accompanied by the word "ONE WAY." Drivers must follow the indicated direction and avoid driving in the opposite direction.</p>
        </div> 
        <h2>6. Pedestrian Crossing Signs</h2>  
        <div class="tut3-item">
            <img src="\Public\Images\tut3_7.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Pedestrian crossing signs are rectangular or diamond-shaped signs with a yellow background and black symbols. They indicate areas where pedestrians may be crossing the road. Drivers should be alert, reduce speed, and give priority to pedestrians at designated crossings.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>7. Traffic Light Signals</h2>  
        <div class="tut3-item">
            <img src="\Public\Images\tut3_8.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Traffic light signals control the flow of traffic at intersections. Red signifies stop, yellow/amber indicates caution or prepare to stop, and green signals drivers to proceed. These signals are typically positioned above or beside the road and have separate lights for each color.</p>
        </div>
        <h1 class="heading">2. Road Marking</h1>
        <p>Road markings play a vital role in guiding drivers and ensuring safe and organized traffic flow. Here are some common road markings along with their descriptions:</p>
        <br>
        <h2>1. Lane Dividers</h2>  
        <div class="tut3-item">
            <img src="\Public\Images\tut3_9.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Lane dividers are solid or dashed lines that separate lanes of traffic. They help drivers stay within their designated lanes and maintain proper spacing. Solid lane dividers indicate no lane changes, while dashed lane dividers allow for lane changes when it is safe to do so.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>2. Center Line</h2>  
        <div class="tut3-item">
            <img src="\Public\Images\tut3_10.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The center line is a solid or dashed line that separates traffic moving in opposite directions. It helps drivers maintain their position and prevents head-on collisions. A solid center line indicates no passing, while a dashed center line allows for passing when it is safe and legal to do so.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>3. Crosswalk</h2>  
        <div class="tut3-item">
            <img src="\Public\Images\tut3_11.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Crosswalk markings are typically parallel white lines painted on the road to indicate pedestrian crossing areas. Drivers must yield to pedestrians within crosswalks and exercise caution to ensure their safety.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>4. Arrows</h2>  
        <div class="tut3-item">
            <img src="\Public\Images\tut3_12.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Arrows are road markings that indicate the direction of traffic flow. They are often found in turn lanes or at intersections to guide drivers on the correct path. Arrows can be straight, curved, or forked, depending on the specific traffic movement.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>5. Stop Line</h2>  
        <div class="tut3-item">
            <img src="\Public\Images\tut3_13.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Stop lines are solid white lines painted across the road at intersections where drivers must come to a complete stop. They are located just before the crosswalk or intersection and serve as a visual reference for stopping vehicles.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>6. Bicycle lane</h2>  
        <div class="tut3-item">
            <img src="\Public\Images\tut3_14.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Bicycle lanes are designated areas on the road for cyclists. They are marked with a solid white line and often have a bicycle symbol. Drivers should avoid entering or obstructing bicycle lanes and give priority to cyclists using them.</p>
